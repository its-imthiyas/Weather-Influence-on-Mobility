## Abstract

As climate change accelerates, the need for timely and accurate weather warnings becomes increasingly critical. This research investigates how different weather conditions impact human mobility patterns across the United Kingdom, aiming to enhance early warning systems and disaster preparedness strategies. 

The study integrates mobility data with meteorological information, bridging the gap between weather forecasts and real-world human behavior. By analyzing the influence of weather on mobility, the research provides actionable insights that can improve public safety, urban planning, and emergency response efforts.

### Key Findings:
- **Significant Impact of Weather Variables**: Temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation all influence mobility, with notable differences between weekdays and weekends. For instance, adverse weather conditions like rain or cold have a more pronounced impact on mobility during weekends compared to weekdays.
- **Regional Differences**: Regional variations in how weather impacts mobility are significant, underscoring the need for localized analysis.
- **Machine Learning and Statistical Models**: The research employs regression analysis, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting techniques to explore the influence of weather on mobility.
  
The insights from this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between weather and human movement, with significant implications for urban planning, infrastructure resilience, and public safety.
